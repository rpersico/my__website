<h2>Before university</h2>
<p>I was born in a little village in the north of <strong>Italy</strong> named <a href="www.google.com/maps/place/10010+Candia+Canavese,+Metropolitan+City+of+Turin,+Italy/@45.3248154,7.8654841,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47887e21002c7b3f:0xd054499c85f1cf3e!8m2!3d45.3280918!4d7.8872502">Candia Canavese</a> where I attended high school. I was a very active kid, playing sports (football, volleyball, swimming) and spending time with my friends.</p>

<div id="university" class="section level2">
<h2>University</h2>
<p>I attended the <strong>BSc in International Economics and Finance at Bocconi University</strong> in Milan. It was a wholesome experience thanks to which I learned a lot and defined clearly what I want to do with my life.
I did an <em>internship</em> at GS in the securities division in my first year and one at BNP Paribas (in M&amp;A) after graduation.</p>
