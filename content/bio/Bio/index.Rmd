# My Story
## Before university
I was born in a little village in the north of **Italy** named [Candia Canavese](www.google.com/maps/place/10010+Candia+Canavese,+Metropolitan+City+of+Turin,+Italy/@45.3248154,7.8654841,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47887e21002c7b3f:0xd054499c85f1cf3e!8m2!3d45.3280918!4d7.8872502) where I attended high school. I was a very active kid, playing sports (football, volleyball, swimming) and spending time with my friends.  
  
## University
I attended the **BSc in International Economics and Finance at Bocconi University** in Milan. It was a wholesome experience thanks to which I learned a lot and defined clearly what I want to do with my life.
I did an *internship* at GS in the securities division in my first year and one at BNP Paribas (in M&A) after graduation.
